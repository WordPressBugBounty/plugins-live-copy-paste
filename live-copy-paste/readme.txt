== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= ü§î How does cross-domain copying work? =

Live Copy Paste uses advanced JavaScript technology to transfer Elementor design data between different websites. When you click the magic copy button, the plugin extracts the complete element data (including all styling, animations, and settings) and stores it in your browser's clipboard. You can then paste this data on any other Elementor website by using Elementor's built-in "Paste from other site" feature.

= üîí Is it safe to use magic copy buttons on live websites? =

Absolutely! The plugin includes multiple security layers. You can configure magic buttons to appear only for logged-in users, specific user roles, or even specific sections. The copy functionality is read-only and doesn't modify your website content. Visitors without proper permissions won't see any copy buttons, ensuring a clean frontend experience.

= üì± Do magic copy buttons work on mobile devices? =

The magic copy buttons are automatically disabled on mobile devices for optimal user experience. This prevents accidental copying and maintains clean mobile design. The functionality works perfectly on desktop and tablet devices where precision clicking is more practical.

= üîÑ Can I copy elements from any Elementor website? =

You can copy elements from any website where you have access to view the page and where Live Copy Paste is installed. The magic copy buttons only appear on websites with the plugin active. For copying from external sites, you'll need to use Elementor's native copy functionality or ensure the target site has Live Copy Paste installed.

= üé® What types of elements can I copy? =

You can copy any Elementor element including sections, containers, columns, widgets, and even complete pages. The plugin preserves all styling, animations, responsive settings, custom CSS, and widget configurations. Complex nested structures and third-party widget settings are also maintained during the copy process.

= ‚öôÔ∏è How do I enable magic copy buttons for specific sections only? =

Go to **Elementor > Settings > Live Copy Paste** and enable "Only for Specific Section". After saving, edit any page with Elementor, select a section or container, go to the **Advanced** tab, and you'll find the **Live Copy Paste** section where you can enable the magic copy button for that specific element.

= üìã Does the duplicator work with custom post types? =

Yes! The duplicator feature works with posts, pages, and Elementor templates. It preserves all metadata, taxonomies, featured images, and custom fields. The duplicated content is created as a draft, allowing you to review and modify before publishing. Custom post types support depends on their implementation but generally works with most standard configurations.

= üîß Is the plugin compatible with other Elementor addons? =

Live Copy Paste is designed to work seamlessly with other Elementor addons. Since it uses Elementor's native data structure and APIs, copied elements from third-party widgets will work correctly as long as the destination site has the same addons installed. The plugin doesn't interfere with other Elementor functionalities.

= üåê Can I use this plugin on multisite networks? =

Yes, Live Copy Paste works perfectly on WordPress multisite networks. You can copy designs between different sites within the same network or between completely different domains. Each site needs to have the plugin installed and activated independently. Network activation is also supported for easier management.

= üÜò What should I do if copying doesn't work? =

First, ensure both sites have Live Copy Paste activated and you're using a compatible browser. Check that JavaScript is enabled and there are no console errors. Verify that magic copy buttons are enabled in settings and you have proper permissions. If copying between different domains, ensure both sites are accessible and not blocked by security policies. For persistent issues, check the plugin support forum for solutions.
